# Dear Visitor
Thank you for visiting! this is my personal portfolio available at: http://benlevi.me

I finished making it by August 2019, using HTML, Sass and jQuery.
I didn't know React at this particular point. I assume that my coding abilities have changed since I started using React, I hope you'd be able to see it.

I don't have any projects shown at my website because I didn't finish them yet.
