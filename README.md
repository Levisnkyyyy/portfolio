# Dear Visitor
Thank you for visiting! this is my personal portfolio available at: http://benlevi.me

I didn't know React at this particular point. I assume that my coding abilities have changed since I started using React, I hope you'd be able to see it.

### Are you a recruiter?
There are some things I want to say.
