# Dear Recruiter

I will probably not know that a recruiter have read this, but I want to thank you first!
Apart from the CV that you received, here I expand it a little bit.

## Myself
I'm a developer for a few years now, more than 5 that's for sure. It's hard to state it like this, because I didn't develop for the full duration of this time, 
I had a few ups and downs, and I didn't take myself in hands until a few months ago. But my knowledge remains the same and expands every time. I consider myself a fast-learner, because I really am! I get things quickly, and have a logical mind apart from being a developer.

I started with Pawn Scripting (which is the scripting language for making GTA San Andreas multiplayer servers). It's pertty close to C. 
I assume this was around the age of 14-15. I was a big fan of the game, particularly the multiplayer, I had run a few servers.

Next up would be Web. I can't remember how and when, but I just started learning from w3schools, which gave me great basis knowledge of other languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.
During this time, I experimented a lot on my own, I really loved it as a child (didn't even think about a job in this field later on, just enjoyed it)
I made a few websites using pure HTML, CSS and PHP, unfortunately I don't have any record of them, and if I had, I doubt that I would have shown it you, since they're very beginner-like.
At a certain point I started learning jQuery (not knowing JavaScript), again from w3scools. JavaScript I actually learned by using jQuery.

All of my past experience led to who I am now. I can say in pride, that I know HTML and CSS pretty well. About 6 months ago I thought to myself why didn't I take a step forward and tried to land a job in this field.
This brought me to making my portfolio, benlevi.me. I built using HTML, Sass and jQuery. I created it in order to make myself an internet presence, and gain clients worldwide.
It is actually not finished yet, as you might see there, I didn't show my current projects, I wish to finish them first and then show them.

For my first 3 clients I decided to learn React, and start using Git. Not surprising, I really loved it.
I still gain knowledge in React as time goes.
My git knowledge is not perfect and I might even consider myself a beginner.

## How do I do my things, how do I learn
I don't like reading from books, and I don't like reading a tutorial (but sometimes you must!). Most of my knowledge was gained using Google, and just Google.
When I encounter a problem, or I wish to make something that I don't know yet, I search it. Most of my learning was done by experimenting, from copying code to understanding how it works, and finally making it on my own.
I believe that everything is possible when it comes to making code, because everything is on the internet.

## What I know
- HTML5
- CSS3 / Scss
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- React (Gatsby, PWAs)
- SQL
- PHP

Apart from knowing these languages, I am also experienced in some of the other tools used to run a website, such as graphics or advertising platforms etc.
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe XD
- Vector Graphics
- Facebook Business (ads and so on)
- Google Ads
- Google Analytics

There's sure more to be on the list. That's kinda irrelevant, but I just want to demonstrate my learning abilities and motivation to do things on my own, and making them from scratch to 100% handmade.

Thank you, sorry for the long read.
