# Dear Recruiter

I will probably not know that a recruiter have read this, but I want to thank you first!
Apart from the CV that you received, here I expand it a little bit.

## Myself
I'm a developer for a few years now, more than 5. It's hard to state it like this, because I didn't develop for the full duration of this time, 
I had a few "ups and downs", and I didn't take myself in hands until a few months ago. But my knowledge remains the same and expands every time.

I started with Pawn Scripting (which is the scripting language for making GTA San Andreas multiplayer servers). It's pertty close to C. 
I assume this was around the age of 14-15. I was a big fan of the game, particularly the multiplayer, I had run a few servers.

Next up would be Web. I can't remember how and when, but I just started learning from w3schools, which gave me great basis knowledge of other languages such as HTML, CSS and PHP.
During this time, I experimented a lot on my own, I really loved it as a child (didn't even think about a job in this field later on, just enjoyed it)
I made a few websites using pure HTML, CSS and PHP, unfortunately I don't have any record of them, and if I had, I doubt that I would have shown it you, since they're very beginner-like.
At a certain point I started learning jQuery (not knowing JavaScript), again from w3scools. JavaScript I actually learned by using jQuery.

All of my past experience led to who I am now. I can say in pride, that I know HTML and CSS pretty well. About 6 months ago I thought to myself why didn't I take a step forward and tried to land a job in this field.
This brought me to making my portfolio, benlevi.me. I built using HTML, Sass and jQuery. I created it in order to make myself an internet presence, and gain clients worldwide.
It is actually not finished yet, as you might see there, I didn't show my current projects, I wish to finish them first and then show them.

For my first 3 clients I decided to learn React. Not surprising, I really love it. It's like a luna park for me, someone who had used pure code to make things.
I still gain knowledge in React as time goes.

## How do I do my things, how do I learn
I don't like reading from books, and I don't like reading a tutorial (but sometimes you must!). Most of my knowledge was gained using Google, and just Google.
When I encounter a problem, or I wish to make something that I don't know yet, I search it. Most of my learning was done by experimenting, from copying code to understanding how it works, and finally making it on my own.
I believe that everything is possible when it comes to making code, because everything is on the internet.

## Why did I apply if I haven't finished projects yet
This question has a personal side, I really really really want to advance forward. I feel like I wasted my time all these years. I believe I could have been a great freelancer if I just took myself in hands earlier.
I'm applying because I think I am already capable of making things happen. And if I don't know how to make something happen, I learn how to make it happen, that's how it always worked for me.
I'm pretty sure that anyone upon receiving the job they always wanted, will dedicate themselves in order to be in line and even better.
